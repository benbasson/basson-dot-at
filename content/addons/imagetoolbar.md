Image Toolbar is a Firefox Add-on that clones an Internet Explorer 6 feature,
providing a quick, easy shortcut to a handful of image functions.

I originally developed Image Toolbar to help users when migrating from Internet
Explorer to Firefox as some deemed this to be a critical missing feature. Later
versions of Internet Explorer removed this functionality, but the Firefox 
Add-on lives on!

How does it work?
-----------------

The toolbar is activated by hovering your mouse cursor over an image. It will
be displayed (by default) in the top left hand corner of the image, and allows
you to save the image or perform other functions.

What features are included?
---------------------------

Image Toolbar provides the following buttons...

* Save - Brings up a save dialog.
* Copy - Copies both the image and its location, which you can then paste into 
  another application.
* Print - Launches a print preview.
* Info - Shows information about the image.
* Folder - Pops open your preferred image folder.

`Ctrl`-clicking or middle-clicking will activate the secondary button 
functions:

* Save - Automatically saves to a preferred image folder.
* Print - Prints directly, skipping the print preview.
* Folder - Let's you choose a new image directory to save to.
