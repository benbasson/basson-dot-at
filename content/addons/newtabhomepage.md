New Tab Homepage is a Firefox Add-on that does what it says on the tin. It
loads your homepage when you open a new tab. Nothing more, nothing less. This 
functionality still doesn't exist as an option in Firefox and at least 180,000 
people seem to agree with me that it's useful.

I deliberately created this to be a simple, no-frills replacement for 
functionality provided by much larger scale add-ons, such as Tab Mix Plus. 

How does it work?
-----------------

Just install it and restart Firefox. Now every time you click to open a new
tab, or press `Ctrl+T`, your homepage will load instead of a blank tab or the
site launcher.

Why no screenshots?
-------------------

There's no user interface! It does what it says above and nothing else.
