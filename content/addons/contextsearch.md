Context Search is a Firefox Add-on that transforms the "Web Search for..." 
context menu (right click menu) item into a submenu containing your installed
search plugins. This allows you to choose which search engine to use for each
search without having to change the selection in the Firefox toolbar.

I originally developed this as I thought it was more useful / intuitive than 
the in-built Firefox behaviour, but the Firefox UI designers at the time did
not agree and suggested it would make a great Add-on instead. I have used it 
just about every day since.

How does it work?
-----------------

Context Search uses your in-built search engine plugins so you don't need to 
configure anything else; just install it and start using it straight away.

What features are included?
---------------------------

By default, the search will open in a background tab (you remain on the page
you're currently reading). However, you can modify the behaviour:

* Middle Click = Open search in a new foreground tab (switch to the new tab)
* `Ctrl` + Click = Open search in a new foreground tab (switch to the new tab)
* `Shift` + Click = Open search in a new window

Adding search engines
---------------------

If you wish to add more search plugins at any time, simply click "Manage 
Search Engines..." from the Search Toolbar's drop-down menu:

Creating search engines
-----------------------

You can find search plugins and get help on creating new / custom plugins at
the [MyCroft Project][1] website.
