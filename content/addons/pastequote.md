Paste Quote is a Firefox Add-on that is designed for old phpBB / vBulletin
style web forums, to help to quote individual sentences a little bit faster.

![Picture of the Paste Quote menu item appearing as an option on the context
menu (right click menu)](/images/addons/pastequote.png)

When you paste using Paste Quote, it simply surrounds the text you're pasting
with [quote] and [/quote]; the BBCode markup for a block quote.

This Add-on has largely been superceded by technologies moving towards Markdown
but I maintain it for the people out there that still have a use for it.

How does it work?
-----------------

Just install it and restart Firefox. You will get a new right click menu option
to Paste Quote whenever you right click inside a text field and have previously
copied some text.
