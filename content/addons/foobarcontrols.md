Foobar Controls is a Firefox Add-on that provides extra buttons that link to
the [Foobar2000][1] MP3 player, allowing you to control it from within your 
browser.

This Add-on was created because there were no MP3 player Add-ons at the time
that supported Foobar2000. This has changed over time, and now there is really
no need for this Add-on to exist; but I maintain it anyway for the few users
still out there that use it.

How does it work?
-----------------

Once installed, this simply adds new buttons to the Firefox Toolbar
customisation palette. You can drag and drop these to any position on your
toolbar.

What features are included?
---------------------------

The following buttons are provided:

* Play
* Pause
* Stop
* Next Track
* Previous Track
* Random Track

The first time one of the buttons is clicked, Foobar Controls will attempt to
locate your installation of Foobar2000. If it cannot find it (which it normally
should manage), then you'll be prompted to browse to the player's .exe file.

Why use Foobar2000?
---------------

It's the most minimal in terms of computing power and the user interface is 
highly customisable. It also has great Digital Signal Processing plugins. 
Basically, it's a great alternative to Winamp.

I wholly recommend that you give [Foobar2000][1] a try if you play music at 
your PC.
