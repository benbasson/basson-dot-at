subtext: TL;DR - written to learn more Ruby, discard my remaining PHP.
description: "I created this website mainly to start a blog, but also to kill off my previous PHP website and teach myself more about Ruby and Sinatra."

I created this website for a few reasons:

* So I could start a [blog][1].
* To teach myself more about Ruby and [Sinatra][2]. 
* To kill off my old PHP website, so I [don't have to use PHP again][3].

The Code
--------

The source code for this website is on [GitHub][4]. If you can learn from it
or use it in any way, then it'll have been worth the effort; please do so.

One of my primary goals was to maximise the _content:code_ ratio, i.e. use the 
least possible Ruby and HAML, not counting third-party Gems that I've 
leveraged.

If you can help me reduce the number of lines required to sustain the current 
functionality (in a sensible, non-[perl-three-line-sudoku-solver][5] way),
then please feel free to send suggestions (or even better, a pull request).

Browser Compatibility
---------------------

I've only really tested this in Firefox, but it's so totally [Bootstrapped][6] 
that I'm sure it works fine in basically anything from the last decade. If it 
doesn't, feel free to [drop me a line][7].
