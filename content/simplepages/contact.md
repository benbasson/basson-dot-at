If you'd like to get in touch, that's great; but please read the following page
first.

Contact Me Directly
-------------------

If you have an issue with a Firefox Add-on, please see below. If you just want 
to get in touch, you can do so via:

<i class="twlogo fa fa-twitter" markdown='1'></i> Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Ben_Basson" rel="me">@Ben_Basson</a>  
<i class="emlogo fa fa-envelope" markdown='1'></i> Email: <contact@basson.at>

Recruiters, I'm flattered, but please actually read 
<a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/benbassonlondon" rel="me">my LinkedIn profile</a> or 
<a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/benbasson" rel="me">my Stack Overflow CV</a> 
before sending me things. In addition, your offer should be spectacular because 
I'm really happy where I am at the moment.

Firefox Add-on Bugs / Suggestions
---------------------------------

I love to hear your suggestions / complaints. However, email is not 
particularly conducive to Getting Things Done. 

If you have a feature request or bug report, please don't email me. Instead, 
please raise an issue on GitHub:

* [Context Search][3] 
* [Context Highlight][4]
* [Foobar Controls][5]
* [Image Toolbar][6]
* [New Tab Homepage][7]
* [Paste Quote][8]

I can't promise I'll deal with it any faster, but it's the right place for it
and at least then I can track the issues properly and other people can see 
responses if they have similar issues / requests.

Blog Feedback
-------------

For comments on blogs, you should see a [Disqus][9] powered comments section 
at the bottom of each article. If it's not there, please get in touch via
one of the above methods and let me know what browser you're using.
