description: "A list of my Firefox Add-ons that have been in development since 2004, the most popular of which are Image Toolbar, New Tab Homepage and Context Search."
---

Over the last 10+ years, I've written some Mozilla Firefox Add-ons which have
achieved relatively decent popularity (currently ~270,000 users). Some were 
written to request, some for my personal use, and some just to learn something 
new.

You'll find all of these Add-ons available for install at the
[Mozilla Add-ons][1] site.

My Add-ons
----------

[Image Toolbar][2]
: Save, copy and print images with a single click.

[New Tab Homepage][3]
: Loads your homepage when you open a new tab.

[Context Search][4]
: Right click and search using a selection of search engines.

[Context Highlight][5]
: Right click and highlight all instances of the selected word within the page. 

[Foobar Controls][6]
: Control the Foobar2000 MP3 player from your toolbar.

[Paste Quote][7]
: Pastes text, surrounding it with [quote][/quote].

Donate
------

If you like using these Add-ons, please do send a small donation. I never 
really set out to make money from these projects (which is just as well,
because I haven't!), but it's always nice to receive a small contribution
towards hosting costs and evening/weekend hours that I used up to push out 
a fix.

Contribute
-----------

The Firefox Add-ons I have written are open source and available on
[GitHub][12]. If you have suggestions or find bugs, then please raise issues in
the relevant GitHub projects. If you are a programmer, feel free to fork and
contribute.
